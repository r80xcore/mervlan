mervlan v0.46

#############################################################

# execute_nodes.sh v0.45 - v0.46
# Reworked to fix broken paths

# mervlan_boot.sh v0.45 -> v0.46
# Added SSH-propagated node actions (nodeenable, nodedisable, setupenable, setupdisable) so main commands fan out to satellites.
# Hardened template injection logic; corrected service-event-nodes.tpl handling so the main router service handler no longer receives the node variant.

# mervlan_manager.sh v0.45 -> v0.46
# Queue-aware, timed restarts: skip duplicate restart_wireless/switch/httpd via /tmp/rc_service/ps and enforce timeouts.
# Global mkdir lock: prevents overlapping runs from clobbering bridges/interfaces.
# VAP wait cap: wait_for_interface limited to ~63 s (exponential backoff).
# Clean bridge teardown: detach all member ports before brctl delbr.
# Safer delif: ignore empty bridge names and dedupe in remove_from_all_bridges.
# Fail-fast env: exit if CHANGES or LOCKDIR aren’t set.
# Full cmdlines: use ps w so token matching is reliable.
# Cleaned stray braces and adjusted client-refresh conditions in mervlan_manager.sh to Ensured only the main router runs collect_clients.sh

# service-event-handler.sh v0.45 -> v0.46
# Added debounce to deflect multi-clicks or multi-calls.
# Added missing executenodes_vlanmgr

# sync_nodes.sh v0.45 -> v0.46
# Hardened to create all runtime directories remotely before file sync.
# Added missing hw_settings.json, preventing the execution of some scripts.

# service-event-nodes.tpl
# Added TEMPLATE_2 mirroring the service-event-handler.sh on main. Used to prevent accidental writes to the main version.

# var_settings.sh v0.45 -> v0.46
# added several definitions that is used in the updated versions.

# index.html 
Updated index.html buttons to send actions through the unified queue, added modal button wiring, and maintained per-action logging/locking.

# mervlan.asp
# Restored action_mode="apply" and built policy-controlled wrappers in mervlan.asp, including sandboxed skip-refresh handling and the shared MVM_trigger pathway.
